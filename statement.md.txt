# Project Statement: Hotel Booking Management System
## 1. Problem Statement
Many small, independent hotels, bed & breakfasts, and guest houses still rely on outdated manual methods like paper logbooks or disjointed spreadsheets to manage their daily room reservations. These manual processes are inefficient, prone to human error (such as accidental double-bookings), and make it difficult for staff to instantly ascertain real-time room availability. Furthermore, calculating final bills manually at checkout is tedious and susceptible to mistakes. There is a critical need for a simplified, digital desktop solution to centralize and streamline these essential front-desk tasks.
## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to develop a standalone, single-user desktop graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to manage the core operational lifecycle of a small hotel property.
### In-Scope:
* **Inventory Management:** Managing a predefined set of rooms with different types (Single, Double, Deluxe, Suite) and pricing structures.
* **Reservation Management:** Facilitating walk-in or phone-based bookings by capturing essential guest details.
* **Availability Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of room status to ensure only currently available rooms can be booked.
* **Occupancy Dashboard:** A clear, tabular view of all guests currently checked into the hotel.
* **Check-Out Process:** A streamlined function to release rooms and automatically calculate the total stay cost based on duration and room rate.
* **Data Persistence:** Secure local storage of all booking and room data using a relational database (SQLite).
### Out-of-Scope:
* Online web-based booking portal for external guests.
* Integration with live credit card payment gateways.
* Multi-user authentication or role-based access control (e.g., separate admin vs. staff logins).
## 3. Target Users
The primary target users for this application are:
* **Hotel Front-Desk Staff:** Receptionists who require a quick, intuitive interface to check guests in and out efficiently during their shifts without extensive training.
* **Small Hospitality Business Owners:** Operators of guest houses or B&Bs who need a reliable, low-cost method to maintain accurate digital records of occupancy and revenue.
## 4. High-Level Features
* **Automated Database Initialization:** The system automatically sets up necessary tables and populates initial room inventory upon first launch, requiring no manual SQL setup.
* **Smart Booking Interface:** An intuitive form for data entry that dynamically filters room selections to show only those currently available, preventing double-booking errors.
* **Live Occupancy Monitoring:** A real-time Treeview dashboard displaying guest names, room numbers, and check-in dates for instant operational awareness.
* **Integrated Check-Out & Billing:** A one-click check-out facility that calculates the final bill amount based on the room price and days stayed, displays it to the user, and updates inventory instantly.
* **Persistent Local Storage:** Utilization of a lightweight SQLite database ensures data integrity and availability across application restarts.
